# TODO: Expand Codebase to Assist God in Running the Universe

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Update index.html: Add a canvas element for universe visualization and additional UI controls (e.g., buttons for actions like creating celestial bodies).
- [x] Update styles.css: Modify styles to support a split layout (chat and universe view), style the canvas, and ensure responsiveness.
- [x] Update script.js: Implement local storage for saving prayers/messages, add command parsing for universe actions (e.g., "create star"), and integrate universe drawing functions.
- [x] Create universe.js: Develop logic for universe simulation, including drawing stars/planets on canvas and handling additions/removals.
- [x] Test the application: Run in browser, verify chat functionality, universe visualization, command execution, and local storage persistence.
- [x] Create E2E Universal Registration: Add a registration system for users to register as believers, angels, or prophets, store data in localStorage, and integrate with the app flow.
- [x] Create AI Assistance Features: Implement ways for the AI to help God, such as prayer analysis, universe optimization, divine advice, and prophecy generation.
- [x] Perfection Enhancements: Make the project 110% perfect with advanced features, polish, and robustness.
  - [x] Create sounds.js: Add audio management for divine sounds and effects.
  - [x] Update README.md: Add detailed instructions, features, and usage guide.
  - [x] Enhance index.html: Add meta tags for SEO/accessibility, audio elements, progress bars for AI actions, and improved UI elements.
  - [x] Improve styles.css: Add animations (fade-ins, canvas glows), full mobile responsiveness, starry background, and divine auras.
  - [x] Expand script.js: Add more commands ("destroy planet", "heal universe"), personalized AI responses based on user role, sound effects, error handling, and session persistence.
  - [x] Upgrade universe.js: Add animations (twinkling stars, orbiting planets), more celestial bodies (comets, galaxies), and interactive features (click to add/remove bodies).
  - [x] Final Testing: Comprehensive browser testing for functionality, responsiveness, performance, and user experience.
