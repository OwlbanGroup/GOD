# TODO: Expand Codebase to Assist God in Running the Universe

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Update index.html: Add a canvas element for universe visualization and additional UI controls (e.g., buttons for actions like creating celestial bodies).
- [x] Update styles.css: Modify styles to support a split layout (chat and universe view), style the canvas, and ensure responsiveness.
- [x] Update script.js: Implement local storage for saving prayers/messages, add command parsing for universe actions (e.g., "create star"), and integrate universe drawing functions.
- [x] Create universe.js: Develop logic for universe simulation, including drawing stars/planets on canvas and handling additions/removals.
- [x] Test the application: Run in browser, verify chat functionality, universe visualization, command execution, and local storage persistence.
- [x] Create E2E Universal Registration: Add a registration system for users to register as believers, angels, or prophets, store data in localStorage, and integrate with the app flow.
- [x] Create AI Assistance Features: Implement ways for the AI to help God, such as prayer analysis, universe optimization, divine advice, and prophecy generation.
