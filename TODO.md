# Next Steps After Stress Test

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyzed stress-test.yml configuration
- [x] Reviewed current performance optimizations (Phase 3.1 complete)
- [x] Identified next priorities from NEXT_STEPS.md

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Install Artillery load testing tool
- [ ] Start the application server (localhost:3000)
- [ ] Run the stress test using Artillery
- [ ] Analyze stress test results (response times, error rates, throughput)
- [ ] Identify performance bottlenecks from test results
- [ ] Implement Phase 3.2: WebGL Shader Optimization (instanced rendering, shader improvements)
- [ ] Optimize API endpoints based on stress test findings
- [ ] Implement Phase 3.4: Caching & Lazy Loading (AI responses, TensorFlow.js)
- [ ] Add request optimization (debouncing, batching, cancellation)
- [ ] Re-run stress test to verify improvements
- [ ] Document performance benchmarks and results
- [ ] Update PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md with stress test results
- [ ] Proceed with Phase 2.5: Performance Benchmarks completion
