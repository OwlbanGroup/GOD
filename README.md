- **Azure Functions**: Serverless processing of divine requests and automation.
- **Foundry VTT**: Integration with virtual tabletop for divine RPG sessions.

### Advanced Features (110% Perfect)

- **Animated Universe**: Twinkling stars, orbiting planets, and interactive celestial bodies.
- **Divine Sounds**: Audio effects for prayers, miracles, and divine actions.
- **Personalized Responses**: AI responses tailored to your role (believer/angel/prophet).
- **Enhanced UI**: Animations, responsive design, and visual effects.
- **Error Handling**: Robust validation and user feedback.
- **Accessibility**: Improved for screen readers and keyboard navigation.

## How to Use

1. **Registration**: Fill out the registration form to become a believer, angel, or prophet.
2. **Pray**: Type your prayers or messages in the chat input and press Send.
3. **Commands**: Use special commands to interact with the universe:
   - `create star` - Add a new star
   - `create planet` - Add a new planet
   - `invoke god` - Summon divine presence
   - `praise god` - Express praise and joy
   - `destroy planet` - Remove a planet (advanced)
   - `heal universe` - Restore cosmic balance (advanced)
4. **AI Features**: Click buttons to analyze prayers, optimize the universe, get advice, or generate prophecies.
5. **Universe Interaction**: Click on the canvas to add or remove celestial bodies.

## Cloud Integration Setup

### Azure Services Configuration

To enable cloud features, configure the following Azure services:

1. **Azure OpenAI Service**:
   - Deploy GPT models for divine responses
   - Configure API endpoints and keys

2. **Azure Blob Storage**:
   - Store encrypted prayers and divine data
   - Enable secure backup and retrieval

3. **Azure Cosmos DB**:
   - Store user profiles and divine records
   - Enable global distribution and low-latency access

4. **Azure Functions**:
   - Serverless processing of divine requests
   - Automate prayer analysis and universe optimization

### Foundry VTT Integration

1. Install Foundry Virtual Tabletop
2. Enable API module
3. Configure connection settings for divine RPG sessions

## NVIDIA Blackwell GPU Enhancements

This application now features advanced GPU-accelerated features inspired by NVIDIA Blackwell architecture:

### GPU-Accelerated Universe Rendering

- **WebGL Particle System**: Stars and planets are rendered as GPU-accelerated particles for smooth, high-performance animations
- **Fallback Support**: Automatically falls back to 2D Canvas rendering if WebGL is not supported
- **Real-time Physics**: GPU-based particle physics with velocity, life cycles, and orbital mechanics

### AI-Powered Features with GPU Acceleration

- **Prayer Analysis**: TensorFlow.js models analyze prayer sentiment and themes using GPU processing
- **Universe Optimization**: AI calculates optimal celestial body distributions for cosmic harmony
- **Prophecy Generation**: GPU-accelerated text generation for dynamic divine prophecies
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: All GPU AI features gracefully fall back to static responses if GPU processing fails

### Performance Benefits

- **Faster Rendering**: WebGL provides hardware-accelerated graphics for smoother universe animations
- **Efficient AI Processing**: TensorFlow.js leverages GPU for faster AI computations
- **Scalable Architecture**: Supports thousands of particles without performance degradation
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on devices with and without dedicated GPUs
